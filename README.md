# BusinessGear

A Spring MVC 4 webshop-like hobby project I'm working on in my free time. It's connected to a MySQL database which is also included as a (db/tables/rows creation included) dump file in the root directory as "mysql_businessgear.sql". I'll keep re-exporting the database as a dump file with the most recent tables and rows. For now, it just contains a few "test" tables & rows. The connection information to the database can be found in businessgear/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/application-servlet.xml bean id: "dataSource".
